# select_architecture.sh
#
# A script for macOS that lets you run a command under a chosen CPU architecture.
# On Apple Silicon (M1/M2), you can run commands under Rosetta (Intel) or natively.
# On Intel-only Macs, specifying x86_64 will simply run commands normally,
# and attempting to specify arm64 will fail if the system doesn't support it.
#
# Usage:
#   ./select_architecture.sh [--intel | --apple-silicon] <command> [args...]
#
# Examples:
#   ./select_architecture.sh --intel uname -m
#   ./select_architecture.sh --apple-silicon uname -m

# Print usage if not enough arguments are provided.
