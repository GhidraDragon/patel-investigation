Page 1: Introduction

Kash Patel is an American attorney who served as a key Republican staffer on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) under then-Chairman Devin Nunes. Patel became closely involved in inquiries related to the 2016 Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. Often referred to as the "Nunes investigation" or the “House Intelligence Committee investigation,” Patel’s work focused on examining the origins and conduct of the FBI’s Russia probe, including the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants on former Trump advisor Carter Page.  

Page 2: Background - The House Intelligence Committee & Devin Nunes

1. Origin of Investigation:
   - In early 2017, HPSCI, led by Devin Nunes (R-CA), launched an investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and any potential links between Russia and the Trump campaign.
   - Concurrently, the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division was conducting its own inquiry, known as "Crossfire Hurricane."

2. The Committee’s Scope:
   - HPSCI’s majority (Republican) and minority (Democratic) members pursued parallel lines of inquiry.
   - Kash Patel, a former federal prosecutor, served as senior counsel and was instrumental in drafting key investigative documents.  

Page 3: Kash Patel’s Role

1. Principal Investigator:
   - Patel led a team examining the intelligence and evidence used by the FBI to justify surveillance warrants.
   - He traveled internationally (including to the UK) to interview officials related to the so-called “Steele dossier.” [1]

2. Authoring the “Nunes Memo”:
   - Patel is widely reported to have been the primary author of the 2018 House Intelligence Committee Republican majority memo (the “Nunes Memo”), which alleged the FBI and DOJ abused FISA in monitoring Carter Page. [2]
   - The memo criticized the FBI for relying on the Steele dossier without properly disclosing its partisan funding origins to the FISA court.

3. Challenges and Criticisms:
   - Democrats on the HPSCI released a counter-memo (often called the “Schiff Memo”), challenging Patel’s conclusions and defending the FBI’s conduct. [3]
   - Critics claimed the Nunes/Patel-led inquiry focused more on discrediting the Russia investigation than fully investigating Russian election interference. [4]  

Page 4: Key Findings & Reports

1. HPSCI Republican-Led Conclusions (March 2018):
   - The HPSCI Republican majority ended their inquiry, concluding there was no evidence of “collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia. [5]
   - They asserted the intelligence community may have been mistaken in assessing Russia’s preference for Trump.

2. HPSCI Democratic-Led Conclusions (Minority Report):
   - The Democratic minority disagreed, stating the investigation was prematurely closed and critical witnesses/documents were not pursued. [6]

3. Broader Context – The Mueller Report (2019):
   - Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump associates and Russia, but detailed extensive Russian interference efforts. [7]
   - It also outlined numerous contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian figures, though not rising to criminal conspiracy.  

Page 5: Controversies & Subsequent Developments

1. Accusations of Partisanship:
   - Patel and Nunes were criticized for allegedly coordinating with the White House, raising concerns about the independence of the investigation. [8]

2. Impact on Public Perception:
   - The release of the “Nunes Memo” and the subsequent “Schiff Memo” sparked significant public debate over the legitimacy of the FBI’s actions in the Russia probe.
   - Patel’s involvement helped shape GOP narratives that the Russia investigation was flawed from the start.

3. Later Roles for Patel:
   - After the House investigation, Patel served in various roles within the Trump administration, including at the National Security Council and the Department of Defense. [9]
   - He continued to advocate against what he viewed as the flawed origins of the Russia investigation.
